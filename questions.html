            1. Now that you've had a chance to implement it, are there different features you would have prioritized, knowing what you know now?
        </h3>
        <h4>Understanding/Planning</h4>
        <p>
            With a firmer grasp at the optics concepts, I think I would do a better job of planning out how the code should look like.
            I got to understand optics better through writing out code trying to model it. Though, the limits of my code suggests there's still more for me to understand about optics. Better understanding for better planning would definitely have helped me optimize my time.
        </p>
        <h4>Instance Mode</h4>
        <p>
            I personally dislike the syntax style of adding p5 prefixes everywhere. For the scope of this project, I felt prioritizing readable js would be reasonable. However, this would definitely be an important thing to prioritize from the start for next time.
        </p>
        <h4>Reworking Normal Calculation</h4>
        <p>
            I definitely would go to rework how the normal is calculated for a line. I feel this got tricky for mirrors away from the origin.
            Ideally, the normal would be able to work for any quadrant and at any rotation.
            With more time, I'd look into using dot products similar to what <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/motion-non-orthogonal-reflection.html">was done here.</a>
            With more testing, figuring out the normal for any given line should allow for the reflections to be easily calculated by reflecting on the normal.
            I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1243676/6137476">used this</a> formula for calculating the normal, but did try out a bunch of other different ways.
        </p>
        <h4>Reworking Light Stoppage</h4>
        <p>
            A tricky problem was in stopping light from continuing past a mirror/wall.
            Due to using a canvas, we cannot truly 'undraw' what's already there, so I implemented a hacky solution of just covering the continuous sections with a black line matching the background.
            I'd prefer to implement a canvas state control of some sort to provide a cleaner way of stopping light and its reflections.
        </p>

            2. How could your interactive be extended to cover more concepts in optics?
        </h3>
        <p>
            From a technical perspective, I did my best to make the code so that it can be easy to improve, maintain, and use as a library for building custom 2D arrangements of mirrors, light, and objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, since the color of each ray of light can be manipulated, a potential extension can be in teaching color with light.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another extension can be in adjusting the shape of light. Instead of a single ray, maybe using multiple or rectangles would be interesting.

            3. What parts of your interactive could be useful in other areas of STEM? Give a few examples.
        </h3>
        <p>
            A possible area could be in understanding trajectory in a game of pool. An overhead view offers a 2D view that can be similarly modeled as optics. Other similar bouncing trajectory concepts could also be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visualizing the math required to calculate the reflections could be useful in teaching geometry or trigonometry. Concepts like normals or deltas could be taught interactively in different ways.
